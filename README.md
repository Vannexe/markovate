A generative Max For Live MIDI device designed for use in Ableton Live.



## Updates / Versions
Markovate 1.0 (November 29 2024) - 
Introducing 'Markovate'.


## Max For Live Device Use - 
Drag and drop the device into a MIDI channel in Ableton Live. VSTi's can be placed after the device.

Click on 'Load MIDI File' to navigate to the MIDI file to be fed into the model. Click on 'Read' to go through the MIDI file, or 'Fast Read' to feed all data into the model at 10x the original speed. Repeat for any number of MIDI files. 

Click on 'BUILD' to push all data into the model. Once the model is built (which usually takes less than a second), hit on 'PLAY' to play the generative output. 

You will see visualisations of output on the on-screen keyboard. Notation will be displayed real-time too. Click on 'HIDE KEYS' or 'HIDE NOTATION' to hide or show the output visualisations. 

Hit 'PAUSE' to pause the output. Hitting 'PLAY' resumes the output. To reset the model, hit 'Reset Model'.



## Note
Reset only if model needs to train from a fresh MIDI file - from scratch.
